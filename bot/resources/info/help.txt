Try this:
     _/subscribe @channel_name_
for example, _/subscribe @telegram_. This would add Telegram News to your feed.

This `feed` is similar to any other feed – RSS, Twitter, Facebook etc. 
You add subscriptions if you want to be notified when some awesome (or mediocre – that's up to you) channels are updated.
Yep, just like the usual channels, but in one place. Because @durov is to busy, y'know.
