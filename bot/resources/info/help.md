Try this:
     /subscribe @channel\_name
for example, /subscribe @telegram. This would add Telegram News to your feed.

This `feed` is similar to any other feed – RSS, Twitter, Facebook etc. 
You add subscriptions if you want to be notified when some awesome (or mediocre – that's up to you) channels are updated.
Yep, just like the usual channels, but in one place. Because @durov is to busy, y'know.

(If you enjoyed reading this message, /help will send it again. ;D)
