Try this:
```
/subscribe @channel_name
```
for example, `/subscribe @telegram`. This would add Telegram News to your feed.

**Commands**

(You can also use `/%first_letter%` (e.g., `/s` instead of `/subscribe`).)

* `/unsubscribe @channel_name` – stop receiving new posts from this channel
* `/list` – show list of channels
* `/export` – get `.csv` file with your subscriptons
* `/help` – send this message again
* `/redirect` 

**Redirect**

If you don't want to receive messages from me and would prefer having a silent channel, try this feature.
1. Create a new channel.
2. Add me to this channel's admins.
3. Send me something like:
```
/redirect @your_new_channel
```
